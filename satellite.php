    We make different kinds of antennas for tracking satellites. We currently have built a QFH antenna and a Yagi-Uda Antenna as part of our ground station.

        foldable Yagi-Uda antenna and also received
        SSTV images from the International Space Station using a hand-held transceiver (Baofeng UV-5R).

        <span class="start">Amateur Radio</span> on the International Space Station (ARISS) is a program to connect
        students and amateur radio
        enthusiasts from around the world to the astronauts at ISS. In this program, astronauts transmit some
        signals for amateur radio enthusiasts to receive them. These signals are usually encoded images transmitted
        using the SSTV communication protocol.

        Inter-MAI-75 (Formation and Popularization of Space Exploration) is
        an experiment by the Moscow Aviation Institute under the ARISS program. Here are some of the images
        successfully received and decoded by our team members

        Due to the coronavirus pandemic and lack of access to our ground station and equipment, we decided to widen
        our scope and explore virtual tracking with the help of webSDRs. It is done by accessing ground stations
        across the world to receive signals. The members of the Student Satellite Program are regularly trained and
        made to compete online to track satellites and receive signals. <br><span class="start">NOAA </span>is a
        US-based agency that deploys a
        series of weather satellites in space and sends images of the Earth. We successfully tracked NOAA 15,18 and
        19 to receive images of the Earth above Europe and America.
