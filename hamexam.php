        You cannot enjoy all the benefits of ham radio without having a Ham Radio License. You can only receive
        signals but you need to have a license and a callsign for legally transmitting on ham radio. Once you have
        the ham radio license, you can talk to other hams, build your own ground station, participate in contests
        and foxhunts and also provide communication assistance during emergencies.
